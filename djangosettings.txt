BASE_DIR -  Django project directory. The same directory where manage.py is located.

SECRET_KEY:
django-admin startproject automatically adds a randomly-generated SECRET_KEY to each new project
All sessions if you are using any other session backend than django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache, or are using the default get_session_auth_hash().
All messages if you are using CookieStorage or FallbackStorage.
All PasswordResetView tokens.
Any usage of cryptographic signing, unless a different key is provided.

DEBUG=True:
One of the main features of debug mode is the display of detailed error pages. If your app raises an exception when DEBUG is True,
 Django will display a detailed traceback, 
including a lot of metadata about your environment, such as all the currently defined Django settings (from settings.py)."
Basically, it's a gaping security hole.
It also wastes a lot of memory:
"It is also important to remember that when running with DEBUG turned on, Django will remember every SQL query it executes. 
This is useful when you're debugging, but it'll rapidly consume memory on a production server."

ALLOWED_HOSTS - A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django site can serve.
This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations.

Middleware - Middleware is something which acts as a bridge between two parts of a program or the system that enables communication between them. 
In technical terms , Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django’s request/response processing. 
It’s a light, low-level “plugin” system for globally altering Django’s input or output. Each middleware component is responsible for doing some specific function.
There are two types of Middleware in Django:
Built-in Middleware
Custom Middleware
Built-in Middleware are provided by default in Django when you create your project. You can check the default Middleware in settings.py file of your project.
Custom Middleware — You can write your own middleware which can be used throughout your project. Let’s see how we can do that!
How to write a custom Middleware in Django? ✍
Create a python package (a folder with __init__.py inside) named as middleware
Create a file named custom_middleware.py (or anything which you like) and a regular Python function / class in it.
You can write middleware as a function or as a class whose instances are callable.
The django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware provides several security enhancements to the request/response cycle.
Each one can be independently enabled or disabled with a setting.
SessionMiddleware - Django provides full support for anonymous sessions. The session framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis.
It stores data on the server side and abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies.
Cookies contain a session ID – not the data itself (unless you’re using the cookie based backend).
Common Middleware - Forbids access to user agents in the DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS setting, which should be a list of compiled regular expression objects.
Performs URL rewriting based on the APPEND_SLASH and PREPEND_WWW settings.
Cross Site Request Forgery Midllware - The CSRF middleware and template tag provides easy-to-use protection against Cross Site Request Forgeries. 
This type of attack occurs when a malicious website contains a link, a form button or some JavaScript that is intended to perform some action on your website, 
using the credentials of a logged-in user who visits the malicious site in their browser. A related type of attack, ‘login CSRF’,
where an attacking site tricks a user’s browser into logging into a site with someone else’s credentials, is also covered.
Adds protection against Cross Site Request Forgeries by adding hidden form fields to POST forms and checking requests for the correct value
AuthenticationMiddleware - Adds the user attribute, representing the currently-logged-in user, to every incoming HttpRequest object.
MessageMiddleware - Enables cookie- and session-based message support. 
X-Frame-Option Middleware - Simple clickjacking protection -An example of clickjacking¶
Suppose an online store has a page where a logged in user can click “Buy Now” to purchase an item. 
A user has chosen to stay logged into the store all the time for convenience. An attacker site might create an “I Like Ponies” button on one of their own pages, 
and load the store’s page in a transparent iframe such that the “Buy Now” button is invisibly overlaid on the “I Like Ponies” button.
If the user visits the attacker’s site, clicking “I Like Ponies” will cause an inadvertent click on the “Buy Now” button and an unknowing purchase of the item.
Configuring TEMPLATES IN DJANGO SETTINGS.PY:
Django template is a text document or Python string marked up that uses Django template language. 
Django keeps the logic and code separate from the design. It is essential to know that Django templates do not contain the embedded code of Python into HTML.
Django templates follow the DRY (do not repeat yourself) design principle, which requires developers to not repeat while designing a Django application. 
Django templates employ several other notions, such as template inheritance, tags, variables, filters, comments, etc.
To configure the Django template system, go to the settings.py file and update the DIRS to the path of the templates folder.
 Generally, the templates folder is created and kept in the sample directory where manage.py lives. 
 This templates folder contains all the templates you will create in different Django Apps.

import os

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
python
Alternatively, you can maintain a template folder for each app separately. If you are maintaining the template for every app separately, 
you don't need to update the DIRS in settings.py. Make sure that your app is added in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py .
